# X-Arena Dashboard Documentation

## Overview Dashboard (Personal Contribution Overview)

The Overview Dashboard serves as the main personal performance tracking module, displaying comprehensive individual contribution metrics for each staff member. The dashboard presents six key performance indicators (KPIs) that provide a holistic view of staff performance: Total Score, which represents the cumulative points earned across all activities; Deposit Score, calculated based on customer deposit amounts; Retention Score, measuring customer retention efforts; Reactivation Score, tracking dormant customer reactivation; Recommend Score, reflecting referral and recommendation activities; and Active Days Score, which includes multiple sub-categories for days 4-7, 8-11, 12-15, 16-19, and 20+ days of customer activity. The dashboard includes four primary visualizations: a breakdown chart showing the distribution of scores across different categories (deposit, retention, reactivation, recommend, and active days), a squad gap chart comparing the individual's performance against their squad's average, a squad share chart displaying the individual's contribution percentage within their squad, and a target progress chart showing achievement against personal targets. All charts use interactive tooltips with green gradient themes and support filtering by month and cycle (All, Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, Cycle 4). The dashboard also displays squad information cards showing squad comparison metrics, deposit per user statistics, and behavior metrics including traffic sources and contribution patterns. Users can filter data by selecting different staff members (for admin/manager roles), month, and cycle, with automatic refresh every 30 seconds to ensure real-time data updates.

## Leaderboard Dashboard

The Leaderboard Dashboard displays a comprehensive ranking system for all staff members based on their total performance scores. The dashboard presents six key metrics: Total Participants, showing the total number of active staff members in the system; Current User Rank, displaying the logged-in user's position in the leaderboard; Current User Score, showing the user's total accumulated points; Top 3 Performers, featuring a podium visualization with gold, silver, and bronze positions; Average Score, calculating the mean score across all participants; and Score Distribution, showing the spread of scores across different ranges. The dashboard includes four main visualizations: a detailed leaderboard table with sortable columns showing rank, name, avatar, total score, and detailed breakdown (deposit, retention, reactivation, recommend, and active days scores), a top performers section highlighting the top 10 members with their respective rankings and badges, a squad comparison view allowing users to filter by Squad A or Squad B to see performance distribution within each squad, and a brand-based view showing performance grouped by brand assignments. The leaderboard supports multiple filter options including Squad filter (All, Squad A, Squad B), Brand filter (showing all brands assigned to squad members), Month filter (selecting specific months for historical data), and Cycle filter (All, Cycle 1-4). Each member entry includes interactive tooltips showing detailed score breakdowns, and users can click on any member to view a detailed modal with complete performance metrics, target comparisons, and historical trends. The dashboard uses color-coded rankings with special badges for top performers (crown for rank 1, medals for ranks 2-3), and includes avatar support from the users_management table for personalized member identification.

## Battle Arena Dashboard

The Battle Arena Dashboard provides a competitive comparison module between Squad A and Squad B, implementing a gamified battle system with achievements and score tracking. The dashboard displays four key performance indicators: Squad A Total Score, showing cumulative points for all Squad A members; Squad B Total Score, displaying cumulative points for all Squad B members; Score Difference, calculating the gap between the two squads; and Leading Squad, indicating which squad is currently ahead. The dashboard includes four primary visualizations: an achievements banner displaying special badges and accomplishments earned by each squad, a battle banner showing the current competition status with visual indicators of which squad is leading, a score breakdown chart comparing Squad A and Squad B across three main metrics (Reactivation from Old Listing, Recommend activities, and Active Member contributions), and a monthly cycle overview chart showing performance trends across four cycles (Cycle 1-4) with bar charts for each cycle. The score breakdown uses a grouped bar chart format with green bars for Squad A and red bars for Squad B, allowing easy visual comparison. The dashboard also includes an accumulate score overview section showing the progression of scores over time, with interactive tooltips displaying exact values when hovering over chart elements. All charts support filtering by month and cycle, with the ability to view overall monthly performance or drill down into specific cycle periods. The system uses PK Score Rules stored in localStorage to calculate battle scores, where reactivation and recommend activities can affect opponent scores (increase, decrease, or no effect) based on configured rules. The dashboard dynamically updates based on brand-to-squad mappings from the brand_mapping table, ensuring accurate squad assignments for all members.

## Customer Listing Dashboard

The Customer Listing Dashboard serves as a comprehensive customer data management module with multiple tabs for different customer categories. The dashboard presents six main tabs: Reactivation, for managing dormant customer reactivation records; Retention, for tracking customer retention activities; Recommend, for managing customer referral and recommendation data; Extra, for additional customer-related information; and Adjustment, for score adjustment entries (X-Arena for individual members and PK-Tracking for squad scores). Each tab displays key metrics including Total Customers, showing the count of customer records in the selected category; Active Customers, displaying customers with active status based on deposit cases in the current month; Inactive Customers, showing customers without active deposits; Total Records, indicating the total number of entries including duplicates; Duplicate Groups, showing the count of duplicate record groups when duplicate filter is active; and Records to Delete, displaying the number of duplicate records that can be removed. The dashboard includes four main visualizations: a customer data table with sortable columns showing unique code, username (for recommend tab), brand, handler (shift), label (active/non-active), and month, a duplicate filter visualization highlighting duplicate records based on unique code + brand + month combination, a search functionality allowing users to filter customers by unique code, and a pagination system showing filtered data counts. The table supports multiple operations including add new customer, edit existing customer, delete single or multiple customers, import from Excel file, and export to Excel. The dashboard features a duplicate detection and management system that allows users to filter and view only duplicate records, with the ability to delete all duplicates while keeping only the newest record per duplicate group. The active/non-active label is automatically determined by checking if the customer has deposit cases greater than zero in the blue_whale_sgd table for the selected month. For operator roles, the dashboard automatically filters data to show only customers matching their assigned shift and brand, ensuring data access control. The adjustment tab allows administrators to add bonus scores for individual members (X-Arena type) or squads (PK-Tracking type), with automatic squad mapping when employee name is selected for X-Arena adjustments.

## Reports Dashboard

The Reports Dashboard provides comprehensive analytical reports comparing Squad A and Squad B performance across multiple dimensions. The dashboard displays four key performance indicators: Net Profit for Squad A, showing total net profit generated by Squad A members; Net Profit for Squad B, displaying total net profit for Squad B members; Total Deposit for Squad A, indicating cumulative deposit amounts; Total Deposit for Squad B, showing cumulative deposit amounts; Total Active Customers for Squad A, counting active customers assigned to Squad A brands; and Total Active Customers for Squad B, counting active customers assigned to Squad B brands. The dashboard includes four main visualizations: a squad comparison card showing leading squad with lead amount and percentage, a detailed metrics table displaying performance breakdown by brand for each squad, including net profit, total deposit, and total active customers per brand, a brand performance comparison chart showing side-by-side metrics for Squad A and Squad B brands, and a monthly trend chart displaying performance progression over time. The reports support filtering by month and cycle (All, Cycle 1-4), allowing users to analyze performance for specific time periods. The dashboard uses brand-to-squad mappings to accurately assign brands to their respective squads, and calculates metrics based on data from blue_whale_sgd table for deposit information and customer_extra table for customer activity tracking. All visualizations include interactive tooltips with detailed information, and the data automatically updates when filters are changed.

## Targets Dashboard

The Targets Dashboard displays target summary information for staff members, showing progress toward individual and squad-level targets. The dashboard presents four key performance indicators: Total Target Members, showing the number of staff members with assigned targets; Members Achieving Target, displaying count of members who have met or exceeded their targets; Members Below Target, indicating count of members who have not yet reached their targets; and Average Target Achievement, calculating the mean percentage of target completion across all members. The dashboard includes four main visualizations: a target summary table showing each member's target breakdown including deposit amount target, retention target, reactivation target, recommend target, and active days targets (days 4-7, 8-11, 12-15, 16-19, 20+), a target progress chart displaying visual progress bars for each target category with percentage completion, a squad comparison view showing target achievement rates for Squad A versus Squad B, and a monthly target overview chart showing target trends across different months. The dashboard supports filtering by month and squad (All, Squad A, Squad B), allowing users to view target performance for specific time periods and squad assignments. Each target category includes both the target value and current achievement value, with color-coded indicators (green for achieved, yellow for in-progress, red for below target) to provide quick visual feedback on performance status.

## Settings Module

The Settings Module provides administrative configuration and management capabilities for the X-Arena system. The module includes three main sub-modules: Target Settings, for managing personal target configurations for each staff member including deposit amount targets, retention targets, reactivation targets, recommend targets, and active days targets (days 4-7, 8-11, 12-15, 16-19, 20+), with the ability to add, edit, and delete target entries; User Management, for managing system users including adding new users, editing existing user information, uploading avatars, assigning roles (admin, manager, operator), and enabling or disabling user accounts; and PK Score Rules, for configuring battle arena scoring rules including points allocation for reactivation activities, recommend activities, and active member contributions, with options to set opponent effects (increase, decrease, or no effect) for each activity type. The settings module also includes additional configuration pages: Squad Mapping, for managing the mapping between usernames and their assigned brands and shifts, which serves as the primary data source for user assignments; Brand Mapping, for managing the mapping between brands and their squad assignments (Squad A or Squad B), used for battle arena calculations; and Appearance Settings, for configuring theme preferences (dark/light mode), language settings (English/Chinese), and other UI customization options. All settings support role-based access control, with admin and manager roles having full access to all settings, while operator roles have limited access to specific configuration options. The module includes audit logging capabilities to track changes made to settings, with filters available by user, action type, table affected, and date range.

## Operator Settings Module

The Operator Settings Module provides specialized management capabilities for operator accounts and their permissions. The module includes three main pages: Operators Management, for managing operator accounts including adding new operators, editing operator information (username, full name, email, password), enabling or disabling operator accounts, assigning operators to specific shifts and brands for data access control, and uploading operator avatars; Operator Roles, for managing role-based permissions where administrators can configure access controls for each role (admin, manager, operator) across different modules (Battle Arena, Leaderboard, Overview, Customer Listing, Targets, Reports, Settings), with granular permissions for view, create, edit, delete, import, and export actions, and the ability to set data filters based on shift and brand assignments; and Audit Logs, for recording and viewing all system activities including create, update, and delete operations across all tables, with comprehensive filtering options by user (showing which user performed the action), action type (create, update, delete), table name (showing which database table was affected), and date range (filtering logs by specific time periods). The audit logs provide detailed information about each action including timestamp, user information, action description, and affected data, ensuring complete traceability of system changes. All modules use a role-based permission system (RBAC) to control access to menus, actions, and data, with Super Admin having full access to all modules and features, while operators have restricted access based on their assigned shift and brand, ensuring they can only view and manage data relevant to their responsibilities.
